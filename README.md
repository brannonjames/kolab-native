# KoLab

A mobile app to help connect new developers based on projects they want to collaborate on. Uses a Tinder like swipe deck,
realtime chat, and native camera support to help with social connectivity.

This app was tested and developed on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Though it should boot on Android, the functionality and 
UI may not work as expected.

## Built With

React Native, Redux, Socket.IO, Expo, Firebase (image upload), Node/Express, PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

To get the app running you'll need the Expo CLI

`npm install -g expo-cli`

then

`npm install` to install dependencies

`npm start` to start expo

## Running the app
To run the app inside the iOS simulator you'll need to have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your Mac,
to run the app on your own device, download the [Expo Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779?mt=8) app from the App Store.

Once Expo has started up, you will be prompt to either open inside the simulator or send yourself an email/sms to open the app.
