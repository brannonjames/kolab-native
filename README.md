# KoLab

A mobile app to help connect new developers based on projects they want to collaborate on. Uses a Tinder like swipe deck,
realtime chat, and native camera support to help with social connectivity.

This app was tested and developed on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Though it should boot on Android, the functionality and 
UI may not work as expected.
